Hi! My name is Runhua Chen. I am currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Electrical Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). I am honored to have been admitted as a Master's student to the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm) at Tsinghua University, starting in the Fall of 2026, under the supervision of [Prof. Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/index.html).

During my undergraduate studies, my research interests have included blockchain (particularly consensus algorithms) and the Internet of Things (especially the Internet of Vehicles). In the future, I plan to delve deeper into machine learning and decision-making problems, with a greater focus on:

• Reinforcement Learning (RL)
